# agent-workflow

Boilerplate for multi-agent software projects — installs the infrastructure
to run a fully automated coder ↔ tester loop via
[Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon), with observability, rate-limit
detection, context efficiency, and regression tests to survive upstream upgrades.

---

## Install into a project

```bash
# Clone and run (recommended — avoids CDN caching):
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Elvis-codeur/agent-workflow.git /tmp/aw
bash /tmp/aw/install.sh /path/to/myproject
rm -rf /tmp/aw

# One-liner:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elvis-codeur/agent-workflow/main/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- /path/to/myproject
```

Safe to re-run — never overwrites files you have already customised.

## After install — four things to customise

1. **`AGENTS.md`** — add your project layout and architectural invariants.
2. **`scripts/check-invariants.sh`** — add `check` calls for your project rules.
3. **`.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `ci.yml`** — uncomment the language tracks you use.
4. **`scripts/aw-test-<scope>.sh`** — add project-specific test runners
   (e.g. `aw-test-backend.sh`, `aw-test-frontend.sh`) so the workflow runs
   the right tests for each epic scope.

---

## Running an epic end-to-end

```bash
# One epic
scripts/aw-run BE-31

# All open epics in dependency order
scripts/aw-run-all.sh

# Dry-run: see the 6-layer plan without running anything
scripts/aw-run-all.sh --dry-run

# Resume after a stop
scripts/aw-run-all.sh --from BE-37

# Override models per-run
scripts/aw-run \
  --coder  pi:github-copilot/gpt-5.3-codex \
  --tester pi:github-copilot/gemini-3-flash-preview \
  BE-31
```

**Defaults** (chosen for throughput, not just capability):
- coder: `pi:github-copilot/gpt-5.3-codex` — code-optimised, 400K context
- tester: `pi:github-copilot/gemini-3-flash-preview` — fastest model, sufficient for test writing
- master: `pi:github-copilot/gpt-5.2` — strong reasoning, used only for arbitration

Requires `archon` ≥ v0.3.10 in PATH.
Full design: `docs/archon-master-loop.md`.

## What happens inside one epic run

```
read-epic → implement → write-tests → run-tests ──(PASS)──► commit → update-context → decide
                                           │
                                           └──(FAIL)──► fix-blocked → rerun-tests
                                                                           │
                                                              (still FAIL) └──► arbitrate → ask-human
```

1. **read-epic** — parses the epic JSON from `progress.*.yaml`
2. **implement** — coder runs gate commands, marks `review`; reads `CODEBASE-SUMMARY.md` at Step 0 to skip ~5 000 tokens of codebase exploration
3. **write-tests** — tester writes test files independently (fresh context = no knowledge of how coder solved it)
4. **run-tests** — project-specific bash runner (`scripts/aw-test-<scope>.sh`)
5. **fix-blocked** — coder fixes failures, up to `--max-fix-attempts` rounds
6. **arbitrate** — master classifies the coder/tester disagreement into one of 8 buckets, emits `coder_right` / `tester_right` / `unsure`
7. **ask-human** — only fires on `unsure`; the one point where the workflow blocks on input
8. **commit** — runs `/commit` skill; never pushes, never opens a PR
9. **update-context** — regenerates `CODEBASE-SUMMARY.md` (zero AI tokens); appends one-line epic log entry
10. **decide** — writes `CONVERGED`/`EXHAUSTED`/`ITERATE`/`FAILED`; `aw-run` reads this and either cleans up or loops

All five AI nodes have `idle_timeout: 120s` — a throttled model that stops responding is killed within 2 minutes.

## Observability

```bash
archon serve                                          # web UI at localhost:3090
scripts/aw-inspect BE-31                              # cost + duration per node
scripts/aw-inspect BE-31 --events | less              # every file read, every bash command
scripts/aw-inspect BE-31 --session                    # path to Pi session JSONL
pi --resume "$(scripts/aw-inspect BE-31 --session)"  # replay + ask follow-ups
```

Full guide: `docs/observability.md`.

## Rate limit detection

When GitHub Copilot (or any provider) throttles a session, you now see:

```
============================================================
  ⛔  RATE LIMIT DETECTED IN THIS RUN
============================================================
  Limit type : 5-hour rolling window
  Reason     : out_of_credits
  Resets at  : 2026-05-23 15:10:00 (in 37 min)

  💡 Switch model: scripts/aw-run --coder pi:github-copilot/gpt-5.3-codex EPIC
============================================================
```

This is printed by `scripts/aw-run` after any failed run. The
`rate-limit-notifier.ts` Pi extension also shows it in real-time in the TUI
during a session.

---

## Gotchas registry — institutional memory

When an agent hits a bug that isn't part of the epic's acceptance criteria
(toolchain quirk, env hazard, codegen oddity), the `/record-gotcha` skill
writes it to `docs/gotchas/`. `scripts/gotchas-index.sh` keeps `INDEX.md`
in sync. Every agent reads the index at Step 0 so the bug isn't rediscovered.

Three gotchas are pre-loaded from building this workflow:

| ID | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| GOTCHA-001 | Pi `bash` tool reporting `grep` exit 1 as a tool failure |
| GOTCHA-002 | Double-quoting `$node.output` in Archon bash: nodes breaking bash |
| GOTCHA-003 | Archon worktree venv having no packages → 63 xfail instead of running |

---

## Regression tests — surviving Archon and Pi upgrades

```bash
# Before upgrading Archon or Pi, run this first:
python3 scripts/aw-regression-test

# Filter by area:
python3 scripts/aw-regression-test archon    # DB schema + CLI flags + YAML
python3 scripts/aw-regression-test pi        # tools + extensions + model format
python3 scripts/aw-regression-test scripts   # our own scripts
```

45 tests across 5 suites. Each failure names the affected script and gives
a concrete fix. Full guide: `docs/regression-testing.md`.

---

## Skills

On-demand procedural workflows — agents load them by reading `SKILL.md`
rather than relying on prose rules they may forget in long sessions.

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/write-progress` | "plan epic X" | Authors or extends a `progress.*.yaml` |
| `/implement-epic` | (called by `implement` node) | Implements an epic end-to-end; marks `review` |
| `/test-and-progress` | (called by `write-tests` node) | Mode A: writes tests; Mode B: runs + reports |
| `/fix-blocked` | (called by `fix-blocked` node) | Fixes failing tests, stays in scope |
| `/aw-master-loop` | (called by `arbitrate` node) | Classifies coder/tester disagreement |
| `/record-gotcha` | "record this bug" | Writes to `docs/gotchas/` + epic's `gotchas:` list |
| `/commit` | (called by `commit` node) | lint → typecheck → test → stage → conventional commit |

---

## Cross-tool skill coverage

| Tool | Auto-loads skills? | How |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | ✅ | `.claude/skills/` symlink |
| Pi | ✅ | `.pi/skills/` symlink + `.pi/settings.json` |
| OpenCode | ⚠️ read-on-demand | `.opencode/commands/` symlink; agent reads via AGENTS.md pointer |
| Codex | ⚠️ read-on-demand | No skill mechanism; agent reads via AGENTS.md pointer |
