# Archon master-loop — design and operations guide

Drives the full coder ↔ tester ping-pong for one epic without a human in
the loop. The [Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon) workflow engine
dispatches each AI role to a separate Pi session and arbitrates disagreements
automatically.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Run all open epics in dependency order (recommended)
scripts/aw-run-all.sh

# Run one epic
scripts/aw-run BE-31

# Run with non-default models
scripts/aw-run \
  --coder  pi:github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.6 \
  --tester pi:github-copilot/gpt-5.3-codex \
  --master pi:github-copilot/gpt-5.2 \
  BE-31

# Dry-run (render YAML, validate, then exit)
scripts/aw-run --dry-run BE-31

# See what a past run did
scripts/aw-inspect BE-31
scripts/aw-inspect BE-31 --events | less
pi --resume "$(scripts/aw-inspect BE-31 --session)"
```

| Node | Type | Role | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read-epic` | AI (master) | reads the epic JSON from `progress.*.yaml` |
| `configure` | bash | reads epic status + test-file presence; outputs JSON skip flags |
| `implement` | AI (coder, **skippable**) | implements, runs gates, marks `review` |
| `write-tests` | AI (tester, fresh ctx, **skippable**) | Mode A: writes test files |
| `run-tests` | bash | calls `scripts/aw-run-tests.sh` → `scripts/aw-test-<scope>.sh` |
| `fix-blocked` | AI (coder) | fixes failing tests, up to `--max-fix-attempts` attempts |
| `rerun-tests` | bash | same as run-tests, after fix-blocked |
| `arbitrate` | AI (master) | classifies disagreement into one of 8 buckets, emits verdict JSON |
| `ask-human` | AI (master) | prompts the user when arbitrate returns `unsure` |
| `implement-and-test` | AI (coder, **single-agent mode only**) | implements + writes tests in one session; skips separate `implement` and `write-tests` |
| `ci-check` | bash | runs `scripts/aw-ci-preflight.sh`: lint, typecheck, lockfiles, migrations |
| `fix-ci` | AI (coder) | fixes CI-only failures (format drift, stale locks, missing migrations) |
| `rerun-ci` | bash | re-runs CI gates after fix-ci |
| `promote-complete` | bash | marks epic `status: complete` in `progress.<scope>.yaml` after tests+CI pass |
| `commit` | AI (master) | runs `/commit` skill — never pushes, never opens a PR |
| `update-context` | bash | regenerates `CODEBASE-SUMMARY.md`; appends epic log line |
| `decide` | bash | writes `CONVERGED`/`EXHAUSTED`/`ITERATE`/`FAILED` to `.archon/state/` |

`implement`, `write-tests`, `implement-and-test`, `fix-blocked`, `arbitrate`, `fix-ci`, and `commit` all have
`idle_timeout: 120000` (2 minutes). If the model stops generating tokens for
2 minutes, Archon kills the node and `decide` writes `FAILED` so `aw-run` can
break the loop rather than hanging for hours.

## Default models

Chosen for throughput — `claude-sonnet-4.6` throttles heavily under sequential
session load on the GitHub Copilot tier.

| Role | Default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| coder | `pi:github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.6` | Strong coding ability, 1M ctx |
| tester | `pi:github-copilot/gpt-5.3-codex` | Different model from coder = independent signal; code-optimised |
| master | `pi:github-copilot/gpt-5.2` | Strong reasoning; only runs on arbitration (rare) |
| max fix attempts | `3` | `--max-fix-attempts N` |
| max arbitration attempts | `3` | `--max-arbitration-attempts N` |
| autocommit | **on** | `--no-autocommit` |
| worktree cleanup | **on** | `--keep-worktree` |
| base branch | repo default (main) | `--from-branch BRANCH` |

**Pi model ref format**: `pi:<catalog-provider>/<model-id>`.  
Run `pi list-models` to see all available models.  
`aw-run` validates the format and exits 2 with a clear error if `/` is missing.

## Phase-skip flags — save tokens on repeat runs

The `configure` node auto-detects skippable phases. No flags needed in most
cases:

| Condition | Auto action |
|---|---|
| Epic `status == review` or `complete` | `implement` skipped |
| `skip_implement` + all test files exist in worktree | `write-tests` also skipped |
| `epic.agent_mode == 'single'` or `--single-agent` flag | `implement` + `write-tests` skipped; `implement-and-test` runs instead |

**Manual overrides:**

```bash
# Skip implement: write tests if missing, then run
scripts/aw-run --tests-only FE-52

# Skip implement AND write-tests: just run existing tests
scripts/aw-run --reuse-tests FE-02

# Granular
scripts/aw-run --skip-implement BE-35
scripts/aw-run --skip-write-tests BE-35

# All flags work with aw-run-all.sh too:
scripts/aw-run-all.sh -- --reuse-tests
```

**Example savings:**
- FE-02 was at `status: complete` — a new run would auto-detect and skip both
  `implement` (~90s, ~15k tokens) and `write-tests` (~50s, ~8k tokens),
  going straight to `run-tests` → `commit` → `decide: CONVERGED`.
- An epic at `review` with test files present → same skip path.
- An epic at `planned` with no test files → full run (`mode: full`).

The configure output is visible in the workflow log:
```
configure: mode=reuse-tests  skip_impl=True  skip_tests=True
           status='complete'  tests_exist=True
```

---

## Single-agent mode — one session for implement + tests

By default the workflow uses two separate sessions: the coder implements, the
tester writes tests independently with a fresh context (`context: fresh`).
This independence is the main defence against the coder and tester reinforcing
the same misunderstanding of the spec.

When independence is not needed (simple epics, tight token budget, unambiguous
acceptance criteria), you can collapse both roles into one session:

```bash
# CLI flag — overrides anything in the progress YAML
scripts/aw-run --single-agent BE-07

# Or declare it per-epic in the progress YAML (auto-detected, no flag needed)
# agent_mode: single          # in the epic entry
```

**What changes:**

| | Split mode (default) | Single-agent mode |
|---|---|---|
| Nodes that run | `implement` then `write-tests` (separate sessions) | `implement-and-test` (one session) |
| Tester context | Fresh — no implementation memory | Full implementation context |
| Progress marker | `review:` (standard) | `review:` prefixed with `[SINGLE-AGENT]` |
| Post-`run-tests` path | Identical | Identical |

**What does NOT change:** `run-tests`, `fix-blocked`, `rerun-tests`,
`arbitrate`, `ci-check`, `promote-complete`, `commit` — the entire
post-implementation DAG is identical.

**The `[SINGLE-AGENT]` marker** is written to the progress file's `review:`
field by the `implement-and-test` node. It is a permanent, searchable audit
trail that future agents and humans can grep for to find epics where the test
independence guarantee was not upheld.

**When to avoid single-agent mode:**
- High-risk epics (auth, migrations, external APIs)
- Epics where the spec is ambiguous enough that a second reading matters
- Any epic that has previously needed `arbitrate` in split mode

See `docs/agent-rules/skills/implement-and-test/SKILL.md` for the full
procedure the agent follows.

## Running all epics — `aw-run-all.sh`

Reads both `progress.*.yaml` files, builds a topological dependency graph,
and runs epics layer by layer:

```bash
scripts/aw-run-all.sh                        # all open epics
scripts/aw-run-all.sh --scope backend        # backend only
scripts/aw-run-all.sh --from BE-37           # resume after a stop
scripts/aw-run-all.sh --continue-on-error    # log failures, keep going
scripts/aw-run-all.sh --workers 2            # 2 epics in parallel per layer
scripts/aw-run-all.sh --dry-run              # print the 6-layer plan, exit
scripts/aw-run-all.sh -- --max-fix-attempts 5  # extra flags forwarded to aw-run
```

After each converged epic, `aw-run-all.sh` merges the worktree branch to
`main` and pushes before starting the next epic.

Logs are saved to `.archon/run-all-logs/<EPIC-ID>.log`.

---

## Context efficiency — CODEBASE-SUMMARY.md

Without this file, each coder/tester session burns ~5 000 tokens exploring
the codebase from scratch (running `ls`, `cat`, `grep` to discover which
packages exist, where tests live, what the gate commands are).

`CODEBASE-SUMMARY.md` pre-digests this into ~600 tokens. Every `implement`,
`write-tests`, and `fix-blocked` node prompt starts with:

```
Step 0 — read context first:
1. CODEBASE-SUMMARY.md           ← module layout, gate commands, test index
2. docs/gotchas/INDEX.md          ← known bugs; skip unless scope overlaps
3. progress.<scope>.yaml          ← confirm epic status + acceptance criteria
```

The `update-context` bash node regenerates the `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED -->` section
after every successful commit — zero AI tokens, pure Python parsing
`pyproject.toml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. The `<!-- AGENT-MAINTAINED -->`
section (architectural patterns, recent epic changes) is appended automatically
by the workflow with one line per epic, also zero AI tokens.

To regenerate manually:
```bash
bash scripts/update-codebase-summary.sh
```

## Rate limit detection

GitHub Copilot throttles aggressively under sequential session load. Two
surfaces expose rate limit events:

**During a Pi session** (`rate-limit-notifier.ts` extension, auto-loaded):
- Catches HTTP 429 with `retry-after` headers → prints reset time in the TUI
- Catches model-reported quota messages (`"out of credits"`, `"rate limit"`, etc.)
- Catches Archon's forwarded `claude.rate_limit_event` JSON

**After a failed `scripts/aw-run`**:
```
============================================================
  ⛔  RATE LIMIT DETECTED IN THIS RUN
============================================================
  Limit type : 5-hour rolling window
  Reason     : out_of_credits
  Resets at  : 2026-05-23 15:10:00 (in 37 min)

  💡 Suggestions:
     Wait for the reset, then re-run: scripts/aw-run EPIC-ID
     Or switch model: --coder pi:github-copilot/gpt-5.3-codex
============================================================
```

The rate limit info is parsed from the Archon run log in
`.archon/run-all-logs/<EPIC-ID>.log` and from
`~/.archon/workspaces/.../logs/<run-id>.jsonl`.

## Observability

See `docs/observability.md` for the full guide. Quick reference:

```bash
archon serve                                   # web UI at localhost:3090
scripts/aw-inspect BE-31                       # cost + duration per node
scripts/aw-inspect BE-31 --events | less       # every tool call
scripts/aw-inspect BE-31 --session             # print resume command (auto-detects pi/claude/codex)
eval "$(scripts/aw-inspect BE-31 --session)"   # execute it directly
```

## Known gotchas and mitigations

| Gotcha | What breaks | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **GOTCHA-001** — Pi bash tool reports `grep` exit 1 as failure | Agent retries harmless searches repeatedly | `bash-normalize-exit.ts` extension normalises exit 1→0 for grep/find/ls |
| **GOTCHA-002** — Double-quoting `$node.output` in bash: nodes | Archon's single-quoted JSON re-wrapped in `"..."` breaks bash when JSON contains `"` | Never use `"$node.output"` in bash: blocks |
| **GOTCHA-003** — Archon worktree venv has no packages installed | Python tests xfail silently (ModuleNotFoundError caught by pytest.xfail) | `aw-test-backend.sh` runs `uv sync --all-packages` before pytest |
| **GOTCHA-004** — Test runner exits 1 → `fix-blocked` skipped | Tests fail but coder never fixes them; workflow goes to arbitrate | Test runners always exit 0; failure via stdout content only |
| **GOTCHA-005** — `aw-decide.sh` marker written to worktree, not main repo | `state=UNKNOWN`; all convergences treated as failures; merges skipped | Use `--git-common-dir` not `--show-toplevel` to find repo root |
| **GOTCHA-006** — pnpm install stdout leaks "Scope:" before PASS | `run-tests.output` is multiline; `== 'PASS'` never matches | Use `&>/dev/null` on install commands, not just `2>/dev/null` |

Full write-ups: `docs/gotchas/GOTCHA-00{1,2,3,4,5,6}-*.md`.

## Speed troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Node hangs for 20+ min on a trivial command | GitHub Copilot throttled — model queued | Switch model; `idle_timeout: 120s` will kill it and `decide` writes FAILED |
| Each epic takes 30+ min (was 5 min manually) | 3–4 sequential Pi sessions per epic hit rate limit | Use gpt-5.3-codex (coder) + gpt-5.3-codex (tester) — both have higher throughput than claude-sonnet-4.6 under sequential load |
| `claude.rate_limit_event` in log with `overageDisabledReason: out_of_credits` | 5-hour or monthly token quota reached | Wait for reset (shown in `resetsAt`), or switch provider |
